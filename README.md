# CineScrapers

Tools for scraping cinema websites, in an effort to eventually create unified
listings data. For now, I'm targetting the handful of independent cinemas
in London that are on my radar.

There's a lot to do just to get that far and frankly I'm not especially expert
at web scraping, so if you're able to contribute it'd be much appreciated!
Also if you know how to get any of this info in a more straightforward way (like
a free API), please let me know!

See [filmhose.uk](https://filmhose.uk) for a website that uses the scraped data.

  scrape the ICA website's film listings into an sqlite file (`showtimes.db`)
* `uv run python -m cinescrapers --list-scrapers` to see the list of scrapers.
