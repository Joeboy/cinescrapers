# CineScrapers

Tools for scraping cinema websites, in an effort to create unified listings
info. See [filmhose.uk](https://filmhose.uk) for a website that uses the
scraped listings.

There's still a lot to do and frankly I'm not especially expert at web
scraping, so if you're able to contribute it'd be much appreciated! Also if you
know how to get any of this info in a more straightforward way (like a free
API), please let me know!
